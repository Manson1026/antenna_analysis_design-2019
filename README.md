# antenna_analysis_design-2019
This project was part of the "Special Antennas-Antenna Synthesis" course in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at AUTH. 

In Part I, the analysis of three antennas and the optimization of certain parameters was required. The antennas were simulated using the 4nec2 software. The geometry of the antennas was first created using MATLAB and the NEC files were then created by using the .m files.

The other part of the project was related to BeamForming and Direction of Arrival algorithms. Several such algorithms were implemented in MATLAB & their behavior was studied and explained. Behavioral analysis of the MVDR beamformer was conducted for varying SNR and minimum angle difference for incoming signals. An explanation of the behavior is also completed. In addition, the limit angle difference for two signals in order to be seperately identified is calculated for the MUSIC direction-of-arrival algorithm.
